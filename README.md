# Hi there! 👋 I'm Kushal Pandya  
🚀 Tech Explorer | Backend Developer | AI & ML Enthusiast  

I'm currently pursuing a **B.Tech in Computer Engineering** at **Charotar University of Science and Technology (Charusat)** with a strong foundation in **data structures, algorithms, machine learning, and web development**.  
I enjoy building **scalable backend systems, AI-powered applications, and real-time intelligent solutions**.

## 🔍 What I’m Working On:
- **RAG-Powered Document Q&A System** – AI-driven contextual PDF query answering using LangChain & LLaMA3.  
- **Unwanted Activity Detection** – Real-time anomaly detection in surveillance using YOLOv5/YOLOv8.  
- **Brain Tumor Classification** – Deep learning models (DenseNet, ResNet) deployed via Streamlit for real-time medical predictions.  
- **CareerMarg** – A scalable student placement & career tracking system with analytics.  
- **GUJTOGUJ** – AI-powered speech-to-text transcription with 85% accuracy.
